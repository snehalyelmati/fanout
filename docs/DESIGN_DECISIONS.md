# Design Decisions

This file records design decisions made during development. Keep new entries dated and concise.

## 2026-06-25

### Keep the normal Pi agent loop first

Decision: Start with Pi-native provider integration and prompt/template workflows. Avoid a custom orchestration loop unless benchmarks show the normal loop fails with async latency.

Reason: Pi already handles sessions, tools, prompts, and provider streaming. Extra orchestration adds risk.

### Stub before live endpoints

Decision: Build realtime and async stubs before using live Doubleword endpoints.

Reason: Async latency and live cost make iteration slow; stubs let us validate provider shape, observability, and UX cheaply.

### Observability is part of MVP

Decision: The first working implementation must record timings, TTFT, token usage, cost, polling, tool timings, and errors.

Reason: The project is about proving latency/cost tradeoffs. Without traces, we cannot compare realtime vs async.

### Async tier is polling-first, not streaming-first

Decision: Treat tier 2 as submit-and-poll unless live testing proves streaming is available.

Reason: Doubleword docs describe async Responses with `service_tier: "flex"`, `background: true`, and retrieval by response ID.

### Planning prompt before strict DAG

Decision: Keep the DAG idea, but do not build a DAG executor initially. Use planning prompts to ask what must be investigated and what can be parallelized.

Reason: A strict DAG can make the system brittle. Prompt-first planning gives flexibility with less code.

### Predictive coding starts as prompting

Decision: Predictive coding begins as prompts that encourage broad investigation, parallelizable tool calls, and research-plan-execute behavior. Indexing is deferred.

Reason: Prompting may capture much of the benefit without building a repo index.

### Subagents deferred

Decision: Do not build subagents initially.

Reason: Normal Pi does not parallelize multiple provider calls in one session. Subagents may be needed later, but provider stubs and observability should come first.

### Model profiles/fusion deferred

Decision: Defer model routing profiles such as cheap investigator, deep researcher, patcher, and reviewer.

Reason: Useful later, but not needed to validate provider mechanics and async latency.

### Batch tier deferred for active workflows

Decision: Do not make batch a normal interactive provider initially. Treat it as future benchmark/eval infrastructure.

Reason: Batch latency does not fit one active Pi turn. It is better for trace replay, evals, and bulk jobs.

### Use this repo for code and resources

Decision: Keep code, docs, fixtures, and sampled traces in this directory.

Reason: The workspace should be self-contained for extension development and benchmarking.

### Stub providers use custom streamSimple

Decision: Register `doubleword-realtime-stub` and `doubleword-async-stub` with custom `streamSimple` implementations instead of proxying a live-compatible API shape immediately.

Reason: The custom stream path validates Pi provider mechanics, event ordering, async polling simulation, and observability before any live Doubleword endpoint assumptions.

### Observability writes are best-effort

Decision: JSONL observability writes must not throw through provider streaming.

Reason: Logging failures should not mask provider errors, aborts, or successful stub responses.
